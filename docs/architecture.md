# Architecture — Agents, Orchestration & Traceability

> All demo data is fictional. DEMO mode is deterministic, offline, and the default;
> LIVE mode engages Azure AI Foundry. Both return the same `MorningBrief` JSON shape
> (Principle III / FR-010).

## Three-layer flow

```
src\ui-app\ ─ POST /api/agent/morning-brief ─► src\orchestration-api\
                                                     │
                            DEMO: deterministic C# composer (offline)
                            LIVE: Foundry agent + client-side tool loop
                                                     │ HTTP only
                                                     ▼
                                      src\mock-api\ (openapi\tools.yaml)
```

Data flows left-to-right only. The frontend is mode-blind. Orchestration code reaches
data **exclusively** over the mock-api HTTP seam — it never reads fixtures in-process
(Principle II / FR-002).

## Where the orchestrator vs. the agent live

| Concern | Lives in | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestrator** (`AgentRunner`, tool functions, `MAX_TOOL_HOPS`, JSON→`MorningBrief` mapping) | **Container App** `orchestration-api` | Owns the flow; constructs `DefaultAzureCredential` only in LIVE. |
| **Agent** (instructions + model `gpt-5.4-mini`) | **Azure AI Foundry** | Hosted on the Foundry Agent Service / capability host. Connected via `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`. |
| **Tool *execution*** | **Container App** | Tools are client-side function tools; the agent only *decides* which to call. |
| **Tool *data*** | **Container App** `mock-api` | Each tool is an HTTP call to a mock system-of-record endpoint. |

A LIVE request bounces between the two:

```
UI → orchestration-api (Container App)
      └─ resolve persistent agent → Foundry agent (gpt-5.4-mini) reasons
            ⇄ tool-call request ──▶ container app runs get_market_data / get_news / …
                                       └─ HTTP ──▶ mock-api (Container App)
            ◀── tool result ──┘   (loops up to MAX_TOOL_HOPS)
      └─ final JSON ──▶ mapped to MorningBrief ──▶ UI
```

## Agent persistence (Foundry)

The morning-brief agent is **persistent** in Foundry — registered once, reused on every request.

- **`src\agent-provisioner\`** is the single registrar. It idempotently creates/updates the
  persistent agent named `morning-brief` (instructions from `Prompts\morning-brief.md`, model
  `FOUNDRY_MODEL`). It runs as a Container Apps **Job** in FULL mode (`task cloud:provision`).
- **`AgentRunner`** (runtime) looks the agent up **by name** via `PersistentAgentsAdministrationClient`
  and reuses it through `AIProjectClient.GetAIAgentAsync(id, tools)`, attaching the mock-api tools
  for client-side execution. If the agent is not found (provisioner has not run yet) it falls back to
  creating one so LIVE still works.

This replaces the earlier per-request `CreateAIAgentAsync` pattern, which created a brand-new agent
on every call — those agents accumulated in the project and fragmented run history. With a single
persistent agent, **all runs/threads appear under one agent** in the Foundry portal.

### The 7 tools

`get_market_data`, `get_news`, `get_relative_value`, `get_client_value_all`, `get_engagement`,
`search_holdings`, `get_axes` — wrappers over `openapi\tools.yaml` endpoints. They never throw;
failures return a structured `{"error": …}` object so the loop degrades gracefully (FR-011).

## Traceability (current state)

**Today**

- Serilog structured JSON logs with a correlation id propagated per request
  (`X-Correlation-ID`), wired in `src\shared\Observability`.
- OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics with ASP.NET Core + outbound-HTTP instrumentation, so tool calls
  surface as HTTP dependency spans.
- The persistent agent's runs and tool-call steps are visible natively in the **Foundry portal**
  (thread/run view), because runs are no longer scattered across throwaway agents.
- **Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry exporter** (`Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter`) attaches
  automatically when `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is set, so traces **and** metrics flow
  to Application Insights in the container apps. The OTLP exporter still attaches in parallel when
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set. DEMO mode stays fully offline — neither exporter attaches
  unless its key is present (`src\shared\Observability\ObservabilityExtensions.cs`).
- **Agent Framework GenAI spans**: the resolved Foundry agent is wrapped with
  `.AsBuilder().UseOpenTelemetry(sourceName: "WF.Garage.Orchestration", …)`, emitting `gen_ai.*`
  spans (model, tool selection, token usage). `EnableSensitiveData` captures prompts/responses
  (data is fictional) and is gated by `OTEL_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` (default on).
- **Agent-run span**: each LIVE morning brief opens one `morning_brief.run` span tagged with the
  event id, mode, model, and `gen_ai.usage.{input,output,total}_tokens`, correlating the full
  UI → agent → tool → mock-api chain.
- **Per-tool-call spans**: every tool invocation runs inside an `execute_tool <name>` child span
  recording the tool name, string arguments, duration, and response size
  (`src\orchestration-api\Agents\AgentRunner.cs`).
- **Metrics**: token usage (`wf.morning_brief.tokens`) and per-tool duration (`wf.tool.duration`)
  histograms are emitted under the `WF.Garage.Orchestration` meter
  (`src\orchestration-api\Agents\OrchestrationTelemetry.cs`).

All custom source/meter names are registered with OpenTelemetry in
`src\orchestration-api\Program.cs` via `AddOpenTelemetry(ServiceName, additionalSources, additionalMeters)`.
Delivered under `specs\_backlog\005-observability.md`.

## Future: multi-agent fan-out / synthesis

The current design is a single agent with client-side tools. The intended evolution is a
**multi-agent flow**: each data pull (market, news, clients, holdings, engagement, …) becomes its
own Foundry agent that returns structured data to a central **synthesizer** agent that composes the
brief. Tracked in `specs\_backlog\011-multi-agent-synthesis.md`.
